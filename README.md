## Introduction
This project uses machine learning models to predict player ratings based on various features from a dataset. It employs several regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to compare performance and accuracy.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regression-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd regression-project
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the data:
   - Add the dataset to the `data/` directory.
2. Run the model training:
   - Modify the parameters in `src/main.py` if needed.
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python src/main.py
     ```

## Models
We trained and tested the following models:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- KNeighbors Regressor
- SVR
- Decision Tree Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor

Check the `src/` folder for the implementation of each model.

## Evaluation Metrics
We used the following metrics to evaluate model performance:
- **R2 Score**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
